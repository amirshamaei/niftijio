# niftijio(7-dimension version)

I forked this repository from [niftijio](https://github.com/cabeen/niftijio), which is a Java library for reading and writing NIfTI-1 image volumes.


## new features:

### NOW niftijio can read NifTi-2 format

*    Support of 7-dimension data
*    Support of Complex 128
*    New example contais downloading, reading and rewriting a simple image time-series in gzipped single file nifti-1 form
*    Develop index iterator tool for iterating over shape of a matrix
*    allowing arbitarary dim shape


## To-do:



*    testing more data sets(both MRI and MRS(I); If you have datsets, specially image data with higher dimension(4), please contact me)
*    adding deafult datatype like nibabel
*    adding random access feature for large volume(ongoing)
*    Converting multi-dimension java array in once to data. (find a way for increasing the speed)
*    support for nifti-2
